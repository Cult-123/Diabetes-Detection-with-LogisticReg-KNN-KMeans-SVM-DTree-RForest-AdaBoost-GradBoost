Python Data Science Project, Diabetes Detection using:

- LogisticRegression (82 % Accuracy)
- KNN (75 % Accuracy)
- KMeans (44 % Accuracy)
- Support Vector Machine (82 % Accuracy)
- Decision Tree (82 % Accuracy)
- Random Forest (82 % Accuracy)
- AdaBoostClassifier (81 % Accuracy)
- GradientBoostingClassifier (81 % Accuracy)

For other Accuracy Details Please Check the Project. Other Accuracy Criterias are AUC & ROC Curve, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report, recall_score, precision_score etc.

## Problem Statement
Credit risk is nothing but the default in payment of any loan by the borrower. In Banking sector this is an important factor to be considered before approving the loan of an applicant. Based on the Customer Data Features Bank will decide to approve the Loan or not.
In this challenge, we have to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of Applicants should be approved for the Loan?” using Applicant's data Features (ie Employ, Address, Creddebt, debtinc, Othdebt etc).

## Project Overview
In this Project I have unleashed the useful Data Science insights using this Bank_Loan dataset and performed the feature selection, feature engineering & missing data handling precisely to build Classification models. In this project I have used 8 types of Classification Algorithms which are Logistic Regression, KNN, KMeans, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Ada-Boost-Classifier, Gradient-Boosting-Classifier. 8 Algorithms along with combining the power of best statistical rules & principles to maximise accuracy at its best followed by all statistical conditions. The best thing is my model is not having any Multicollinearity Problem. All features are fulfilling Statistically Significant concept respect to the target variable.
