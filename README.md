# Diabetes-Detection-with-LogisticReg-KNN-KMeans-SVM-DTree-RForest-AdaBoost-GradBoost
Python Data Science Project, Diabetes Detection using:

- LogisticRegression (82 % Accuracy)
- KNN (75 % Accuracy)
- KMeans (44 % Accuracy)
- Support Vector Machine (82 % Accuracy)
- Decision Tree (82 % Accuracy)
- Random Forest (82 % Accuracy)
- AdaBoostClassifier (81 % Accuracy)
- GradientBoostingClassifier (81 % Accuracy)

For other Accuracy Details Please Check the Project. Other Accuracy Criterias are AUC & ROC Curve, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report, recall_score, precision_score etc.

## Problem Statement
Diabetes Detection is nothing but detecting a patient is diabetic or not. In medical sector Doctors & Medical Rsearchers have collected biological details of diabetic & non diabetic patients. Based on these feature details we have to create a predictive model so that by feeding these features the model will detect/predict a patient is diabetic or non diabetic.
In this challenge, we have to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what kind of significant symptoms/features are liable to make a patient diabetic or non diabetic”, using Patient's data Features (ie BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, Glucose-Level, BMI-Level, Age-Category, Pregnancies-Category etc).

## Project Overview
In this Project I have unleashed the useful Data Science insights using this Diabetes dataset and performed the feature selection, feature engineering & missing data handling precisely to build Classification models. In this project I have used 8 types of Classification Algorithms which are Logistic Regression, KNN, KMeans, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Ada-Boost-Classifier, Gradient-Boosting-Classifier. 8 Algorithms along with combining the power of best statistical rules & principles to maximise accuracy at its best followed by all statistical conditions. The best thing is my model is not having any Multicollinearity Problem. All features are fulfilling Statistically Significant concept respect to the target variable. I also have balanced the Target Variable ie Outcome by using Over Sampling Technique.

## Selected Features
From the Diabetes DataSet, Statistically Significant Selected Features are as follows:

- 'DiabetesPedigreeFunction' - Diabetes pedigree function

- 'Glucose-Level_High' - Categorical Feature

- 'BMI-Level_Normal' - categorical Feature

- 'Age-Category_Middle_Aged' - Categorical Feature

- 'Age-Category_Senior_Citizen' - Categorical Feature
